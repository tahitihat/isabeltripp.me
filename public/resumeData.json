I chose software engineering as a career because I can take my skills to any of the myriad industries that interest me as a multipotentialite. Another important thing to know is that I'm on a quest to find the world's most \"perfect\" cinnamon bun. Currently in the lead: my dad's recipe + Zeit F√ºr Brot in Berlin.",
